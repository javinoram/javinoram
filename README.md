Hello there, I'm Javier. Just a chilean guy that like to study spin system and do software from time to time.

Working at INACH and studying a glaciology master degree.

You can contact me sending an email to javier.norambuenal(*)sansano.usm.cl (replace * by @).

## Little projects
- [VqePy](https://github.com/javinoram/VqePy): Python library that implement a interface to construct spin model representantions and execute variational quantum algorithms.
  - The available models are Molecules, Fermi-Hubbard and spin models.
  - The available methods are VQE.
- [SpinSim.jl](https://github.com/javinoram/SpinSim.jl): Julia package that allow to construct matrix representations of spin models and compute some quatities of interest.
- [SMMCodes](https://github.com/javinoram/SMMCodes): Repository with scripts to simulate different SMM and their differents properties.
- [C++ quantum circuit](https://github.com/javinoram/MyQuantumCircuit): My implementation of a quantum circuit in C++ having a small set of gates.
