Hello there, I'm Javier. Just a chilean guy that like to code physics problems (related to spin models) and try to get into a glaciology program.

## Projects
- [VqePy](https://github.com/javinoram/VqePy): Python library that implement a interface to construct spin model representantions and execute variational quantum algorithms.
  - The available models are Molecules, Fermi-Hubbard and spin models.
  - The available methods are VQE.
- [SpinSim.jl](https://github.com/javinoram/SpinSim.jl): Julia package that allow to construct matrix representations of spin models and compute some quatities of interest.
- [SMMCodes](https://github.com/javinoram/SMMCodes): Repository with scripts to simulate different SMM and their differents properties.
- [C++ quantum circuit](https://github.com/javinoram/MyQuantumCircuit): My implementation of a quantum circuit in C++ having a small set of gates.
